# Ably Video Chat


## Getting Started

This guide will show you how to quickly set up a video chat system with this library.

### Initialising the library



```javascript
    
```

### Compatability
This library currently requires **Chrome/Edge 80+, Opera 67+** on desktop, and **Chrome/Android Browser 106+, Samsung Internet 13+, Opera Mobile 64+** on mobile.  

This is due to the use of the [CompressionStream](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CompressionStream) API.
This requirement could be removed with the introduction of a 3rd party gzip compression library.
